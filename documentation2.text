Weather Forecast Data Pipeline
API: Extract real-time and historical weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Processing: Use PySpark to process and aggregate weather data, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions across multiple cities.
Analysis: Use Pandas and NumPy to calculate daily averages, and temperature trends, or correlate weather patterns with other factors.
Storage: Store the data in SQLite or MySQL for future queries and reporting.
Visualization: Use Matplotlib to visualize weather trends (e.g., temperature and humidity over time, comparison between cities) through line graphs or scatter plots.
